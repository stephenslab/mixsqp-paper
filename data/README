The giant_height_summary_statistics.txt.gz file contains summary
statistics for 2,126,678 genetic markers (SNPs) from the GIANT study
(GIANT is short for "Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric
Traits"). These summary statistics were computed from a meta-anlysis
of 79 genome-wide association studies of human height; see Wood et al
(2014), "Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and
biological architecture of adult human height," Nature Genetics 46:
1173-1186. The original source file for these data is
GIANT_HEIGHT_Wood_et_al_2014_publicrelease_HapMapCeuFreq.txt.gz from
http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant, the GIANT
project Wiki site.

The columns from left to right are: (1) chromosome number, (2) SNP
base-pair position (based on human genome assembly 19, NCBI release
37); (3) dbSNP identifier; (4) reference SNP allele; (5) alternative
allele; (6) estimate of the coefficient (slope) in the linear
regression; (7) standard error of the coefficient estimate; (8)
meta-analysis p-value reported in Wood et al, 2014; and (9) number of
observations.

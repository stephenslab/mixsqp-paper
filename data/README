All raw and processed data used in the experiments are stored here.
Below are brief descriptions of some of the files included in this
directory.

giant_height_summary_statistics.txt.gz
--------------------------------------

The file contains summary statistics for 2,126,678 genetic markers
(SNPs) from the GIANT study (GIANT is short for "Genetic Investigation
of ANthropometric Traits"). These summary statistics were computed
from a meta-anlysis of 79 genome-wide association studies of human
height; see Wood et al (2014), "Defining the role of common variation
in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height,"
Nature Genetics 46: 1173-1186. The original source file for these data
is GIANT_HEIGHT_Wood_et_al_2014_publicrelease_HapMapCeuFreq.txt.gz
from http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant, the GIANT
project Wiki site.

The columns from left to right are: (1) chromosome number, (2) SNP
base-pair position (based on human genome assembly 19, NCBI release
37); (3) dbSNP identifier; (4) reference SNP allele; (5) alternative
allele; (6) estimate of the coefficient (slope) in the linear
regression; (7) standard error of the coefficient estimate; (8)
meta-analysis p-value reported in Wood et al, 2014; and (9) number of
observations.

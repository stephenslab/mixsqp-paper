Description: This package implements several algorithms for solving
    the "mixture distribution optimization problem." This problem has
    many applications; to take one example, it arises in Empirical
    Bayes mixture methods and the Kiefer-Wolfowitz procedure for
    estimating nonparametric mixtures.

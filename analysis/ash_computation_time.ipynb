    "# Profiling adaptive shrinkage computations with mix-SQP and IP solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial motivation for this work was our interest in applying a nonparametric Empirical Bayes method, “adaptive shrinkage,” to very large data sets. These Empirical Bayes computations involve three steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. likelihood computation,\n",
    "2. maximum-likelihood estimation of the mixture proportions, and\n",
    "3. posterior computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we profile the runtime of each of these steps, in which the second step (maximum-likelihood estimation) is solved using either an interior point method (`MOSEK`) or the SQP algorithm we have developed. Our initial solution used the commercial interior point solver MOSEK (called via the `KWDual` function in the `REBayes` R package), and here we show that the mix-SQP solver yields a large improvement in performance, to the point that the model fitting step is no longer the predominant step in terms of computational effort.\n",

    "The adaptive shrinkage calculations from the [ashr package](https://github.com/stephens999/ashr) are reproduced here in Julia."
